    </div>
    <div class="small-12 medium-8 cell highlight">
      <p>With a passion for efficiency, and effective design, my focus is helping design and development teams build and maintain thoughtful design systems. With a background in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) and multi-brand organizations, my experience has taught me the value of scale; using atomic design principles and modern development methods to bridge the gap between design and development.</p>
      <p>Aside from my career, I'm a husband, a father of two, and an avid cyclist.</p>
