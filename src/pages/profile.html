      <p>What started as a love for visual design and applications, evolved into a blend of solving complex UX problems and delivering clean, effective, front-end experiences. With a heavy focus on Atomic Design and Design Systems, my experience with multi-platform organizations has taught me the value in thinking large.</p>
      <p>Aside from my career, I'm a husband, father of two and an avid cyclist.</p>
